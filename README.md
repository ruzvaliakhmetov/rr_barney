# RR Barney
RR Barney is a playful and optimistic, all caps font. Itâ€™s hand drawn and imperfect to give it a warm homemade feel. In terms of proportions, it draws inspiration from classical Roman forms. RR Barney is especially suited for handmade crafts, making greeting card or designs intended for children, as well as adding an open and inviting feeling to your graphic design projects.

> Please note that RR Barney is a work in progress and may not be perfect or complete. This font project was created for learning purposes to master Glyphs and Git, aiming to enhance skills in type design, version control, and collaboration within a creative context.

## Future plans
RR Barney is an evolving project, and its development will continue to enhance both its design and functionality. Here are some planned improvements:
- **Alternative letters**: there are plans to create alternative letterforms for certain characters.
- **Character set expansion**: additional symbols and special characters will be added to cover most latin-based languages.
- **Cyrillic improvements**: at this point, Cyrillic is not perfect. Continuous refinement and improvement of the font's design will be carried out.

## Language support
The characters set covers Nordic Latin and Turkic Cyrillic alphabets:
- Bashkir, Danish, English, Finnish, Icelandic, Kazakh, Norwegian, Russian, Swedish, Tatar & Turkish
